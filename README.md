# XMEN: XML for the Entrerprise

A fast and efficient implemention of XML and related technologies in Zig with high-level APIs for both Python and JavaScript.

## Get Started

### NodeJS & BunJS

    npm i @wrnrlr/xmen
    bun i @wrnrlr/xmen
    deno i npm:@wrnrlr/xmen

The APIs are the same on BunJS as on NodeJS, however the BunJS version uses `bun:ffi`.

### Browser


### Python

    pip install

### Zig

    zig fetch git+https://github.com/wrnrlr/xmen

## Current Status

[x] XML 1.1
[x] SAX
[ ] XPath 3.1
    [x] Parser
    [ ] Evaluator
[ ] Namespaces & QName

## Developer Instructions

To build XMEN from source zig is required.

    zig test src/*.zig
    zig build


## Proposed JavaScript API

```typescript
import { parseXML, xpath, sax } from './index.ts';

const xml = `
<root>
  <child attr="a">A</child>
  <child attr="b">b</child>
</root>
`;

// Parse XML document from string
const doc = xml(xml);

// Select element in XML document
const nodes = xpath('/root/child[@attr="A"]', doc)
for (const node of nodes)
  console.log(node.toJSON())

// Test SAX parsing
for await (const event of sax(xml))
  console.log(event)
```

## Proposed CLI

```bash
$ xmen xpath -f <URL|FILE|DIR> /library/book
```

## TODO

* Maybe use [SegmentedList](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/std/#std.segmented_list.SegmentedList) for `NodeList`.
* Investigate what [String interning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning) would mean doe api design and what speed trade-offs are involved. .

## Issues

### Parent removal logic can misbehave

In Node.setParent:

    if (n.parent()) |ancestor| {
        switch (ancestor.*) {
            .element => |*e| e.children.remove(n),
            .document => |*d| d.children.remove(n),
            else => unreachable,
        }
    }

Problem: remove on a NodeList might fail silently or leave stale pointers if not found.

Suggestion: Either assert the removal was successful or handle the case where the child isn't found (especially for cyclic reference prevention).


### Dom improvements

Document ownership clearly: either setNamedItem takes ownership, or it copies the node. Make the contract explicit in the function comment.

For safety you could make setNamedItem set the caller's pointer to null (if you change the signature to accept * *Node), so it's obvious to the caller that the pointer was moved. But thatâ€™s an API change.

Add a debug-time assertion or helper to check for double-free in tests (e.g. only call defer attr.destroy() when you know you still own it).
